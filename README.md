# Custom Node.js HTTP Server

This is a learning project where I built a basic HTTP server using *Node.js core modules only* (no Express).

## Features
•⁠  ⁠Serves static HTML files
•⁠  ⁠Basic routing using ⁠ req.url ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Correct MIME type handling
•⁠  ⁠Custom 404 error page

## Tech Stack
•⁠  ⁠Node.js
•⁠  ⁠http
•⁠  ⁠fs
•⁠  ⁠path

## How to Run
```bash
node server.js
```
Open in browser:
http://localhost:3000

## Learning Outcome
this project helped me understand how HTTP servers work internally, how routing is handled using req.url, and how proper MIME types prevent forced file downloads
